# DAP-HAI — Research Profile

### Focus Areas
- Human–AI interaction and collaborative reasoning  
- Behavior and failure modes of large language models  
- Structured descriptions of decisions, actions, and task flows  

### Methods
- Designing small, reproducible experiments with language models  
- Logging and comparing model behavior under controlled prompting  
- Building diagrams, taxonomies, and lightweight formal schemas to clarify mechanisms  
- Synthesizing ideas from AI, cognitive science, and related theory into clear, usable models  

### Ongoing Work
- Modeling how agents select and sequence actions in tasks  
- Analyzing recurring patterns in model behavior under different interaction patterns  
- Designing reusable human–AI collaboration templates for analysis, drafting, and review workflows
