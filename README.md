## About

DAP-HAI is an independent research initiative focused on  
**human–AI collaborative reasoning, interaction architectures, and the formal analysis of large-model behavior**.  
Our work explores how human cognition and language models can be aligned through structured methods,  
experimental constraints, and reproducible analytical workflows.

## Research Themes

### **1. Human–AI Interaction & Cognitive Interfaces**
- Interaction protocols for high-bandwidth co-reasoning  
- Adaptive task flows and structured decision models  
- Error-pattern mapping and conversational failure taxonomy  

### **2. Model Behavior & Failure Analysis**
- Controlled-prompting experiments  
- Comparative behavior logging under reproducible conditions  
- Breakdown modes, stability issues, and reasoning drift  

### **3. Formal and Semi-Formal Modeling**
- Task-flow schematics, diagrams, and lightweight structural models  
- Representing decisions, actions, and event sequences  
- Integrating insights from AI, cognition, and systems theory  

---

## Methods

- Designing **small, reproducible experiments** with language models  
- Logging, comparing, and clustering model behavior  
- Building **diagrams, taxonomies, and structural schemata**  
- Translating complex insights into **clear, usable models**  
- Iterative refinement of human–AI collaboration templates  

---

## Current Work

- Modeling how agents select and sequence actions in tasks  
- Identifying recurring model-behavior signatures  
- Designing reusable **interaction frameworks** for research workflows  
- Developing early-stage tools for structured reasoning processes
